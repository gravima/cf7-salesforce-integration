# CF7 Salesforce Integration

The CF7 Salesforce Integration plugin enables seamless connection between Contact Form 7 forms and Salesforce, allowing form data to be sent directly from the client-side. This ensures that Salesforce can track user interactions effectively using the browser's cookies and headers.

## Features

- **Direct Client-Side Submission**: Submits form data directly to Salesforce from the client, preserving user session details.
- **Configurable Salesforce Endpoint**: Easily configure the Salesforce endpoint URL directly from the WordPress admin panel.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Includes custom JavaScript to enhance form interactions such as disabling the submit button temporarily to prevent duplicate submissions and handling redirects upon successful form submissions.

## Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**: Clone the [repository](https://github.com/gravima/cf7-salesforce-integration) or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/gravima/cf7-salesforce-integration/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. **Upload Plugin Files**: Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/cf7-salesforce-integration` directory, or install the plugin using the ZIP file through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. **Activate the Plugin**: Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. **Configure Salesforce Endpoint**: Go to `Settings` > `Reading` in your WordPress admin panel and find the 'Salesforce Endpoint URL' setting. Enter the endpoint URL provided by your Salesforce configuration.

## Usage

Once the plugin is active and the Salesforce endpoint is configured:

- Forms will automatically capture and send data to the specified Salesforce endpoint when submitted.
- Additional JavaScript enhancements like button disabling and redirect handling will be active.

## Customization

To customize JavaScript behaviors or add more features:

- Modify the `js/custom-form-submit.js` file.
- Ensure that your changes maintain the integrity of form submissions and user experience.
